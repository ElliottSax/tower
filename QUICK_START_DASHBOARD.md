## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **Uploading without marketing** (books need visibility)
❌ **Setting prices too low** ($2.99 minimum for 70% royalty)
❌ **Ignoring keywords** (SEO is critical for discovery)
❌ **No email list** (leaving money on table)
❌ **Giving up at 30 days** (SEO takes 60-90 days)
❌ **Not tracking data** (can't optimize what you don't measure)
❌ **Analysis paralysis** (done is better than perfect)

✅ **Do this instead**:
- Upload consistently (50-100 books/week)
- Price strategically ($3.99-9.99)
- Optimize keywords for each book
- Build email list from day 1
- Give it 90 days minimum
- Track everything in spreadsheet
- Launch imperfectly, optimize later

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: No sales after 2 weeks
**Solution**: Check keywords, update description, run ads, lower price to $0.99 for visibility

### Problem: Low conversion rate
**Solution**: Improve book description, add social proof, update cover if needed

### Problem: High ad costs
**Solution**: Narrow targeting, improve ad creative, test different audiences

### Problem: Etsy listings not selling
**Solution**: Improve product photos, optimize titles, adjust pricing, add more designs

### Problem: Affiliate site not converting
**Solution**: Add more content, improve CTAs, test different programs

### Problem: Feeling overwhelmed
**Solution**: Focus on ONE project for 30 days, then expand
