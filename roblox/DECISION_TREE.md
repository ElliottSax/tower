## 💡 Recommendations by Situation

### "I have no budget and need income ASAP"
→ **BUILD PREMIUM** (24-30 weeks)
- Launch Standard at Week 20 for early revenue
- Add Premium features Weeks 21-30
- Use Week 20-24 revenue to self-fund Premium features
- Expected: $2K-3K/month at Week 20

### "I have $5K-10K saved/available"
→ **BUILD WORLD-CLASS** (40-52 weeks)
- Phased approach: Launch Standard at Week 24
- Use initial revenue + budget for contractors
- Add Premium + World-Class features incrementally
- Expected: $2K-3K/month at Week 24, scaling to $16K-40K/month by Week 52

### "I can only commit 4-5 months"
→ **BUILD STANDARD** (16-20 weeks)
- Fastest to market
- Lowest complexity
- **But:** Lowest expected value, most post-launch work
- **Consider:** Premium is only +8-10 weeks for 10.6x better value

### "I want to compete with Adopt Me / Brookhaven"
→ **BUILD WORLD-CLASS** (40-52 weeks)
- Only version with proven addiction mechanics
- Pet collection + gacha + trading economy
- 70% success probability
- $200K-500K/year realistic

### "I'm not sure, need to test first"
→ **BUILD STANDARD, evolve to World-Class (phased)**
- Week 0-24: Standard development
- Week 24: Launch, validate core gameplay
- **Decision Point:** If successful, continue to Premium/World-Class
- If unsuccessful, stop and pivot (minimal loss)
- Best risk management strategy

## 🚨 Common Mistakes

### ❌ "I'll build Standard to save time"
**Problem:** Premium is only +8-10 weeks but 10.6x better expected value
**Solution:** Build Premium or do phased approach

### ❌ "I can't afford World-Class ($5K-10K budget)"
**Problem:** You CAN afford it with phased approach
**Solution:**
1. Launch Standard at Week 24 → $2K-3K/month
2. Months 1-3 revenue = $6K-9K
3. Use revenue to fund contractors
4. Add World-Class features Weeks 25-52

### ❌ "World-Class takes too long (1 year)"
**Problem:** Actually launches at Week 24 (6 months) with phased approach
**Solution:**
- Week 24: Launch Standard (start earning)
- Week 36: Add Premium (3x revenue)
- Week 52: Full World-Class (10x revenue)

### ❌ "I'll build Standard and add features later"
**Problem:** Architecture decisions early matter
**Solution:** Plan for World-Class from Day 1, implement in phases

## ✅ Decision Checklist

### Choose STANDARD if ALL of these are true:
- [ ] You CANNOT commit more than 20 weeks
- [ ] You CANNOT raise $5K-10K ever
- [ ] You're okay with $30K-40K/year max
- [ ] You're okay with 30% success probability
- [ ] You're willing to work 25-30 hrs/week post-launch

**Reality Check:** Only choose Standard if you truly cannot do Premium. Premium is objectively better for almost the same effort.

---

### Choose PREMIUM if ANY of these are true:
- [ ] You can commit 24-30 weeks
- [ ] You don't have $5K-10K budget
- [ ] You want to work solo (no contractors)
- [ ] You want 3-10x better value than Standard
- [ ] You want LESS post-launch work than Standard

**Best For:** Solo developers with time but no budget

---

### Choose WORLD-CLASS if ANY of these are true:
- [ ] You have $5K-10K available (or can raise from Phase 1)
- [ ] You can commit 1 year
- [ ] You want highest expected value ($350K/year)
- [ ] You want to compete with top Roblox games
- [ ] You want 70% success probability
- [ ] You want LEAST post-launch work (15-20 hrs/week)

**Best For:** Serious developers ready to build AAA game

---

## 🎯 The Math (Simple)

**Time Investment (Year 1):**
- Standard: 2,200 hours
- Premium: 2,300 hours (only +100 hours!)
- World-Class: 3,500 hours (+1,300 hours)

**Expected Value:**
- Standard: $10,800/year
- Premium: $115,000/year (10.6x better for +100 hours!)
- World-Class: $350,000/year (32x better for +1,300 hours)

**Return per Extra Hour:**
- Premium vs Standard: +$1,042 per extra hour
- World-Class vs Premium: +$181 per extra hour

**Every extra hour on Premium vs Standard earns you $1,042!**

---

## 🔥 Final Recommendation

### 95% of developers should choose: PREMIUM or WORLD-CLASS

**Why Standard is NOT recommended:**
- Only +100 hours (+4 weeks) to Premium
- Premium is 10.6x better expected value
- Premium has LESS post-launch work (20-25 vs 25-30 hrs/week)
- Premium solves content velocity (biggest risk)

**Choose Premium if:**
- No budget available
- Solo developer
- Want high value without contractors

**Choose World-Class if:**
- $5K-10K budget (or can raise from Phase 1 revenue)
- Want to compete with top games
- Want highest success probability (70%)
- Want least post-launch work

- Validate core gameplay is fun
- Same prototype for all three versions

### 4. Final GO/NO-GO Decision (End of Week)

## 🏆 One-Sentence Summary

**If you have time and can raise $5K-10K, build World-Class (70% success, $350K/year). If no budget, build Premium (45% success, $115K/year). Never build Standard (objectively worse than Premium).**
