## 🗺️ Strategic Journey

### The Three Pivots

**Pivot #1: Pure Obby → Roguelike Obby**
- **Why:** Obby market declining, Tower of Hell dominates (26.6B visits)
- **Result:** Better differentiation with roguelike mechanics

**Pivot #2: Roguelike → Social Racing**
- **Why:** 1.9x session time with friends (official Roblox data)
- **Result:** Multiplayer focus for better retention

**Pivot #3: Social Racing → Tower of Hell Clone + Progression**
- **Why:** 5 fatal flaws in head-to-head racing:
  1. Competitive games harm friendships
  2. Network latency creates unfairness
  3. Procedural generation = RNG imbalance
  4. Tower of Hell is NOT head-to-head (shared tower + timer)
  5. CPU limits with small instances
- **Result:** Final model = Tower of Hell mechanics + skill-based progression

---

## 🎮 What Is Tower Ascent?

**Game Type:** Obby (obstacle course) with meta-progression

**Core Loop:**
1. Join server (20-50 players)
2. Climb procedurally generated tower (50 sections, 8-minute timer)
3. Earn coins based on distance reached
4. Spend coins on permanent upgrades (double jump, faster climb, air dash)
5. Repeat with new towers and growing abilities

**Differentiation from Tower of Hell:**
- ✅ Meta-progression (ToH has none)
- ✅ Daily challenges
- ✅ 4 difficulty modes (Easy, Normal, Hard, Nightmare)
- ✅ Team cooperative mode
- ✅ Battle pass + VIP subscriptions
- ✅ (Premium) UGC marketplace, streamer tools, ranked competitive
- ✅ (World-Class) Pet collection, trading economy, gacha, social hub

**Differentiation from Tower of Misery:**
- ✅ Skill-based upgrades (NOT pay-to-win power-ups)
- ✅ True ToH experience (8-min rounds, 50 sections vs 5-min, 5 sections)
- ✅ More features (UGC, pets, trading, guilds)
- ✅ Ethical monetization (no stage skipping, no immunity)
