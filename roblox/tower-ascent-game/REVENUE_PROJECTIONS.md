## MONETIZATION STRATEGY

### Revenue Stream 1: VIP Pass (Permanent Membership)

- VIP Pass Price: 500 Robux
- Monthly Revenue: 50 × 500 = 25,000 Robux

Annual Revenue:

- USD Conversion (1 Robux = $0.0035): $1,050 USD

Per-Player Economics:
- VIP Players: 50/month
- Revenue/VIP: $21/year
- VIP Lifetime Value: $50-100 (estimate)
```

#### Optimistic Projections (10,000 MAU)
