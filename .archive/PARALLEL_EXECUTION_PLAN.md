# Parallel Execution Plan
## All Three Paths Simultaneously (Maximum Velocity!)

**Date:** 2026-01-26
**Strategy:** Triple-track approach for maximum speed
**Timeline:** 2 weeks to have everything running in parallel
**Mindset:** Work smart, not just hard

---

## 🎯 The Three-Track Strategy

Instead of choosing one path, we'll run **three parallel workstreams**:

### Track 1: 🏗️ BUILD (Option A - Dive In)
**Goal:** Extract MobileGameCore & start technical foundation
**Time:** 2-3 hours/day
**Days:** Monday-Friday
**Output:** Working code, systems ready

### Track 2: 🧠 PLAN (Option B - Strategic)
**Goal:** Deep understanding, documentation, strategy
**Time:** 1-2 hours/day
**Days:** Monday-Friday evenings
**Output:** Knowledge, refinements, confidence

### Track 3: 🎨 PROTOTYPE (Option C - Validate)
**Goal:** Paper/digital prototype to test core mechanic
**Time:** 2-4 hours
**Days:** Weekend sprint
**Output:** Playable proof of concept, user feedback

**Total Time Investment:** 15-20 hours/week (sustainable pace)

- Ruler (measure height)
- Paper tower (track stack)

**Rules:**
1. Draw random treasure card
2. Roll die (1-6) for placement position
3. Stack card on tower
4. Roll stability check (even = stable, odd = wobble)
5. If 3 wobbles in a row = game over
6. Height in cards = score

**Afternoon Session (2-3 hours):**
```
14:00 - 15:00  Playtest with 3+ friends/family
15:00 - 16:00  Gather feedback (what's fun? what's not?)

- Are you excited to build it?

**If YES (Proceed):**
- [ ] Document what worked
- [ ] List improvements for full version
- [ ] Estimate development time adjustments

**If NO (Pivot):**

## 🎯 Daily Schedule Template (Week 1)

### Optimal Time Blocks

**MORNING BLOCK (BUILD - 2-3 hours)**
*Best for: Deep work, coding, extraction*
- 09:00 - 12:00
- High energy, no interruptions
- Focus on TRACK 1 (BUILD)

**AFTERNOON BREAK**
- 12:00 - 14:00
- Lunch, exercise, rest
- Step away from computer

**AFTERNOON BLOCK (Optional Work)**
- 14:00 - 17:00
- Light work if energy permits
- Or save for weekend

**EVENING BLOCK (PLAN - 1-2 hours)**
*Best for: Reading, thinking, planning*
- 19:00 - 21:00
- Lower energy, reflective mode
- Focus on TRACK 2 (PLAN)

**WEEKEND BLOCKS (PROTOTYPE - 4-6 hours each day)**
*Best for: Creative work, testing*
- Saturday: Build prototype
- Sunday: Test & validate

---

## 🔄 Parallel Work Benefits

### Why This Approach Works:

**1. Different Energy Levels**
- Morning: High energy → Coding (BUILD)
- Evening: Lower energy → Reading (PLAN)
- Weekend: Creative energy → Prototyping

**2. Continuous Progress**
- Never stuck waiting
- Always moving forward
- Multiple wins per day

**3. Cross-Pollination**
- Reading informs coding
- Coding validates planning
- Prototype tests assumptions

**4. Risk Mitigation**
- Prototype fails? Still have MobileGameCore
- Extraction has issues? Still learned strategy
- Not sure about Game #1? Try different prototype

**5. Psychological Benefits**
- Constant progress = motivation
- Variety = less burnout
- Multiple accomplishments = confidence

**HIGH ENERGY (Morning)**
→ Coding, extraction, technical work
→ TRACK 1 (BUILD)

**MEDIUM ENERGY (Afternoon)**
→ Testing, bug fixing, organization
→ TRACK 1 or 3 (BUILD or PROTOTYPE)

**LOW ENERGY (Evening)**
→ Reading, note-taking, strategizing
→ TRACK 2 (PLAN)

**CREATIVE ENERGY (Weekend)**
→ Prototyping, experimentation, testing
→ TRACK 3 (PROTOTYPE)

**TIRED/BURNT OUT**
→ Play games (competitor research!)
→ Watch gamedev videos
→ Sketch ideas
→ Or just REST (important!)

## 🚫 Avoid These Traps

### Common Mistakes with Parallel Work:

❌ **Context Switching Too Much**
- Don't switch tracks every 30 minutes
- Stick to schedule (morning = build, evening = plan)

❌ **Perfectionism on Prototype**
- Prototype should be UGLY
- Test concept, not polish

❌ **Skipping Weekends**
- Prototype track happens on weekend
- Don't try to do it during week

❌ **Not Documenting Decisions**
- Write down what you learn
- Track changes to plans

❌ **Burnout**
- 15-20 hours/week is sustainable
- 40+ hours/week will burn you out
- This is a marathon, not a sprint

✅ **Do This Instead:**
- Respect the schedule
- Take breaks
- Celebrate small wins
- Adjust timeline if needed

---

## 📊 Week 1 Time Budget

| Track | Time/Day | Days | Total Hours |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| BUILD (Mon-Fri AM) | 2.5 hours | 5 days | 12.5 hours |
| PLAN (Mon-Fri PM) | 1.5 hours | 5 days | 7.5 hours |
| PROTOTYPE (Weekend) | 3 hours avg | 2 days | 6 hours |
| **TOTAL** | - | - | **26 hours** |

**Sustainable?** Yes! (3.7 hours/day average)

**Compare to:**
- Full-time job: 40 hours/week
- Side project: 10-15 hours/week
- This plan: 26 hours/week (doable!)

**Adjust if needed:**
- Busy week? Do 15-20 hours
- Vacation week? Do 40+ hours
- Listen to your body

---

## 🎯 Decision Points

### By End of Week 1, You'll Know:

**Technical Confidence:**
- ✅ Can I extract and reuse code? (TRACK 1)
- ✅ Is MobileGameCore architecture sound?
- ✅ Do I understand Unity package management?

**Strategic Confidence:**
- ✅ Do I understand the full roadmap? (TRACK 2)
- ✅ Is 18-month timeline realistic for me?
- ✅ Do I believe in the revenue projections?

**Gameplay Confidence:**
- ✅ Is Loot Stack Mayhem fun? (TRACK 3)
- ✅ Do people enjoy the prototype?
- ✅ Am I excited to build this?

### If ALL THREE = YES:
→ **FULL SPEED AHEAD! Proceed to Week 2 development!** 🚀

### If ONE = NO:
→ **Identify the issue:**
- Technical? Get help, read Unity docs
- Strategic? Adjust timeline, lower scope
- Gameplay? Try different game concept

### If TWO+ = NO:
→ **Pause and reflect:**
- Is now the right time?
- Do I need more preparation?
- Should I start smaller?

## ✅ Your Next Action (RIGHT NOW!)

### Choose Your Starting Point:

**Option 1: Start with BUILD (Most Common)**
```bash
cd /mnt/e/projects
mkdir -p MobileGameCore/Runtime/Core
# Begin Day 1 Morning schedule above
```

**Option 2: Start with PLAN (If Unsure)**
```bash
# Open and read for 1 hour:
/mnt/e/projects/MOBILE_GAME_CONCEPTS_PLAN.md
# Then start BUILD tomorrow morning
```

**Option 3: Start with PROTOTYPE (If Skeptical)**
```bash
# Gather paper, scissors, dice
# Build paper prototype for 2 hours
# Test with 3 people
# Then start BUILD if prototype is fun
```

**My Recommendation: Start with BUILD!**
- Extraction is mechanical (easy to start)
- Builds momentum immediately
- Plan in evenings while extraction processes mentally
- Prototype on weekend when you have prototype code to reference

---

## 🎉 Week 1 Success = Triple Victory!

By end of Week 1, you'll have:

1. **✅ MobileGameCore** - $10,000+ value (reusable for all 5 games)
2. **✅ Strategic Mastery** - Complete understanding of 18-month plan
3. **✅ Validated Concept** - Proof that Game #1 is fun

**That's incredible progress in just 7 days!**
