## Priority #2: Lower Middle-Market PE Firms

### Overview
Lower middle-market PE firms target $10M-$250M enterprise value deals, typically with $2M-$50M EBITDA. These firms manage $100M-$2B+ in AUM and are hungry for proprietary deal flow that doesn't come through traditional channels.

**Why Target Tier 1 First:**
- Highest pain point (active need for deal flow)
- Shortest sales cycle (urgent timeline)
- Best product-market fit
- Proven willingness to pay

**Target Count: 150 contacts**

#### Segment 1A: Active Traditional Search Funds (50 contacts)

**Criteria:**
- Raised search capital in last 12 months

**Prioritization Score:**
- Search month 6-12: Score 10 (prime frustration period)
- Search month 12-18: Score 8 (getting urgent)
- Search month 0-6: Score 5 (still optimistic)
- Search month 18+: Score 7 (desperate but may be unfundable)

**How to Identify:**
- Searchfunder.com announcements (search launches)
- Investor portfolio pages (recently backed searchers)
- LinkedIn job changes (joined search fund in last 12 months)
- Stanford/HBS/Wharton ETA club announcements

**Outreach Message Angle:**
- "You're 8 months in - here's how to see the deals brokers aren't showing you"
