# Outreach Templates for DealSourceAI

## Email Template #1: Search Fund (Initial Outreach)

**Subject:** Off-market deal sourcing for [FUND_NAME]

**Body:**
```
Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I saw you're searching for a business to acquire through [FUND_NAME].

Quick question: How much time are you spending on deal sourcing vs. actually evaluating good opportunities?

Most searchers we talk to spend 60-70% of their time finding leads, only to compete against 50+ bidders when they find something interesting.

We built DealSourceAI to solve this: **AI-powered sourcing that finds retiring business owners BEFORE they list with brokers.**

Here's how it works:
- We scrape 50-state business registries + analyze 7 retirement signals (owner age, tenure, digital decay, etc.)
- Deliver 100 qualified leads/month with contact info
- Send 20 personalized AI outreaches on your behalf
- You talk to the 8-12% who reply (vs. 3% on cold outreach)

**Real result:** One of our pilot searchers got 6 interested conversations in the first month. All off-market.

Would you be open to a 15-min demo? I can show you:
1. Sample leads in your industry/geography
2. Live retirement scoring
3. Example AI-generated outreach messages

We're offering 50% off ($10K/month vs. $15K) for our first 2 search fund clients.

Interested?

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]

P.S. - 63% of search funds take 18-24 months to find a deal (Stanford 2024). Our pilot clients are cutting that in half.

## Email Template #2: PE Firm (LinkedIn Connection)

**Subject:** [FIRM_NAME] - proprietary deal sourcing

**Body:**
```
Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I noticed [FIRM_NAME] focuses on [INDUSTRY] in the [GEOGRAPHY] market – exactly where we're seeing massive retirement activity.

Are you relying on brokers for deal flow, or do you have a proprietary sourcing engine?

We built DealSourceAI specifically for lower middle-market PE firms like yours:

**The problem:** Broker deals = 50-100 bidders, prices 3-5x higher than off-market

**Our solution:** AI-powered retirement signal detection
- Scrape Secretary of State registries + business licensing (all 50 states)
- ML model scores retirement likelihood (owner age, tenure, digital decay, 7+ signals)
- Deliver 200 qualified leads/month + send 100 personalized outreaches
- **You only talk to interested sellers** (8-12% reply rate)

**Real ROI:**
- Traditional sourcing: $100-200K/year for researchers → 20 leads/month
- DealSourceAI: $25K/month → 200 leads/month + we do the outreach

One of our pilot clients (small PE firm) closed 2 proprietary deals in Q4 from our pipeline. Both at 4.5x EBITDA vs. 6-7x they were seeing on-market.

Worth a 15-min call to see if this fits your sourcing strategy?

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]

P.S. - Happy to send you a sample report of 25 scored leads in your target market just to show you what we're finding.

## Email Template #3: Independent Sponsor (Value Prop)

**Subject:** Deal flow for independent sponsors

**Body:**
```
Hi [FIRST_NAME],

Saw your profile – looks like you're sourcing [INDUSTRY] deals in the [GEOGRAPHY] market.

Quick question: What's your biggest challenge as an independent sponsor – finding good deals or raising capital once you have one?

Most independent sponsors we talk to say it's 50/50. Hard to raise capital without a strong pipeline, but hard to build a pipeline without capital for sourcing.

We built DealSourceAI to solve the sourcing side:

**What we do:**
- Find off-market retiring business owners (before they list)
- AI retirement scoring (owner age, tenure, digital decay signals)
- Personalized outreach at scale (8-12% response rate)
- Deliver qualified pipeline of interested sellers

**Pricing that works for independent sponsors:**
- $15K/month for 100 leads + 20 outreaches
- OR $25K/month + 1% success fee (only pay when you close)

**Why this matters for you:**
✅ Show LPs you have consistent proprietary deal flow
✅ Spend your time on diligence/value-creation (not sourcing)
✅ Off-market deals = better pricing = better returns

One of our clients uses our white-label reports in their LP updates. Shows deal flow momentum.

Interested in seeing how this could work for you?

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]

## Email Template #4: Follow-Up (No Response After 7 Days)

**Subject:** Re: Off-market deal sourcing for [FUND_NAME]

**Body:**
```
Hi [FIRST_NAME],

Following up on my note from last week about DealSourceAI.

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this short:

**What we do:** Find retiring business owners before they list with brokers

**How it works:**
1. AI scrapes 50-state registries + scores retirement likelihood
2. We deliver 100 qualified leads/month
3. We send 20 personalized outreaches on your behalf
4. You talk to the ~10 who reply

**Cost:** $15K/month (we have a 50% pilot offer right now)

**ROI:** Our pilot searcher got 6 interested conversations in month 1. All off-market.

If this isn't a priority right now, no worries – just let me know and I'll stop bothering you.

But if you're spending hours on ZoomInfo/Grata/manual research, this might save you 20+ hours/week.

Worth a 15-min demo?

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]

P.S. - Here's a sample report of 10 scored leads in [INDUSTRY]: [LINK]

## Email Template #5: "Break-Up" Email (No Response After 3 Touches)

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

**Body:**
```
Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I've reached out a couple times about DealSourceAI (off-market deal sourcing for search funds).

Haven't heard back, so I'm assuming:
A) Not interested
B) Bad timing
C) My emails are going to spam

Which one is it?

If it's A or B, just let me know and I'll close your file.

If it's C, or if you want to see a quick demo, hit reply and we'll set something up.

Either way, appreciate you letting me know so I can stop clogging your inbox.

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]

P.S. - If you know another search fund or PE firm that IS looking for proprietary deal flow, I'd appreciate an intro. Happy to pay a referral fee if they become a client.

## Email Template #6: Case Study/Social Proof

**Subject:** How [PILOT_CLIENT_NAME] found 3 off-market deals in 60 days

**Body:**
```
Hi [FIRST_NAME],

Wanted to share a quick case study that might be relevant for [FUND_NAME].

**Background:**
[PILOT_CLIENT_NAME] is a search fund out of [SCHOOL]. They were 8 months into their search, had looked at 40+ deals, but everything was either too expensive or too competitive.

**What we did:**
- Month 1: Delivered 100 scored leads in their target market (manufacturing services, Southeast)
- Month 2: Sent 20 personalized outreaches, got 7 responses
- Month 3: 3 of those turned into serious conversations

**Result:**
They're now in LOI discussions with 2 of them. Both off-market, both at <5x EBITDA.

**Their quote:**
> "DealSourceAI gave us proprietary deal flow we couldn't have found ourselves. The retirement scoring is legit – these owners were ready to sell, they just didn't know how to start the process."

**Cost:** $30K over 3 months ($10K/month pilot pricing)

**ROI:** If they close either deal, they saved 6-12 months of search time + found deals at 20-30% better pricing than on-market comps.

Think this could work for your search?

Happy to send you a sample report to see the quality of leads we're finding.

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]
```

## Email Template #7: Sample Lead Report (High-Intent Nurture)

**Subject:** Sample report: 10 hot leads in [INDUSTRY]

**Body:**
```
Hi [FIRST_NAME],

As promised, here's a sample of what DealSourceAI delivers:

**[LINK TO PDF: 10 Scored Leads in TARGET_INDUSTRY]**

Each lead includes:
- Company name, revenue, location
- Owner name + contact info (email, phone, LinkedIn)
- Retirement score (0-100) with signal breakdown
- Business overview + why they're a good target

These are real leads from our last batch. All score 70+ (high retirement likelihood).

**What happens if you were a client:**
1. You'd get 100 of these per month
2. We'd send personalized outreach to 20 on your behalf
3. You'd talk to the 8-12% who respond
4. We'd keep feeding you leads until you find your deal

**Next step:**
If these look interesting, let's do a 15-min call to see if this fits your acquisition criteria.

I can show you:
- How the retirement scoring works
- Example outreach messages we'd send
- Response rates we're seeing
- Pilot pricing ($10K/month for first 3 months)

When works for a quick call?

Best,
[YOUR_NAME]

P.S. - Two of the leads in this report are already being contacted by our pilot clients, so if you want access to leads like this, we should talk soon.

## Call Script Template (Demo Call)

### Introduction (1 min)
```
Hi [FIRST_NAME], thanks for taking the time.

Before I show you the platform, tell me a bit about your search:
- What industries/geographies are you targeting?
- How are you sourcing deals today?
- What's been the biggest challenge – finding deals or getting sellers to engage?

[LISTEN]

Great, that's exactly what we built this for. Let me show you how it works...
```

### Demo (10 min)
```
**Screen 1: Lead Database**
"This is our scored lead database. We have 12,000 businesses right now, all with retirement scores.

See this one? 85 score. Why?
- Owner is 67 years old
- Owned business for 22 years
- Website hasn't been updated in 3 years
- No social media activity
- Industry: manufacturing (high retirement rate)

That's what we call a HOT lead."

**Screen 2: Filters**
"You can filter by:
- Industry
- Geography
- Revenue range
- Retirement score
- Established year

Let me filter for [THEIR CRITERIA]...

[SHOW RESULTS]

See? 47 matches. These are all score 70+."

**Screen 3: Outreach**
"For Professional tier, we don't just give you the list – we DO the outreach for you.

Here's an AI-generated message for this lead:
[SHOW CLAUDE OUTPUT]

Notice:
- It's personalized (mentions their business specifically)
- Positioned as individual buyer (not PE)
- Soft ask (exploratory conversation, not aggressive pitch)

We send 20 of these per month on your behalf."

**Screen 4: Results**
"Here's what our pilot client saw in month 1:
- 100 leads delivered
- 20 outreaches sent
- 11% reply rate (7 responses)
- 3 turned into calls
- 1 is now in LOI stage

Cost: $10K/month
ROI: Finding a deal 6-12 months faster = priceless."
```

### Close (4 min)
```
"So, does this seem like something that could help your search?"

[LISTEN TO OBJECTIONS]

**Common objections:**

"This seems expensive"
→ "Compared to what? If you hire a researcher, that's $100-150K/year. We're $15K/month and we do MORE than a researcher – we score leads AND do outreach."

"I'm not sure if I need this"
→ "Fair enough. What's your current deal flow look like? How many interested sellers did you talk to last month? If it's more than 10, you probably don't need us. If it's less than 5, we can 3-4x that."

"I want to think about it"
→ "Totally understand. What specifically do you want to think about – pricing, fit, or something else? Let me address that now so you have all the info."

**THE CLOSE:**
"We have 2 pilot spots left at $10K/month (50% off). If you start by [DATE], you'll get your first 25 leads within 7 days.

Want to give it a shot? Worst case, you cancel after month 1 and you're out $10K. Best case, you find your deal in the next 90 days and save 12 months of searching.

Should we get started?"
```
