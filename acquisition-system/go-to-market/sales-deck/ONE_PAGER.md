# DealSourceAI: Off-Market Deal Sourcing for PE Firms & Search Funds

## The Problem
PE firms and search funds waste $100-200K/year on manual deal sourcing, only to compete in crowded broker auctions. **63% of search funds** spend 18-24 months finding 1 deal.

## Our Solution
**AI-powered proprietary deal sourcing service** that finds retiring business owners BEFORE they list with brokers.

### How It Works:
1. **Scrape** 50-state business registries + marketplaces
2. **Score** retirement likelihood using ML (age, tenure, digital decay, 7+ signals)
3. **Enrich** contact info via 5-provider waterfall (80%+ hit rate)
4. **Outreach** with Claude AI personalization (8-12% reply rate vs 3% industry avg)
5. **Deliver** qualified pipeline of interested sellers

## Why Us?
✅ **Off-market deals** (before competitive auctions)
✅ **Proprietary retirement signals** (no one else has this)
✅ **Fully managed** (we do the outreach for you)
✅ **Proven results** (3-4x higher response rates)
