# DealSourceAI: Proprietary Off-Market Deal Sourcing
## AI-Powered Retirement Signal Detection for PE Firms & Search Funds

## The Problem

### PE Firms & Search Funds Face a Deal Sourcing Crisis

**Traditional methods are broken:**
- 📉 **Broker deals**: 50-100 bidders, auctions drive prices 3-5x higher
- 🔍 **Manual sourcing**: Costs $50-150K/year for researchers, 10-20 leads/month max
- 🤖 **AI platforms** (Grata, etc.): $2-10K/month but YOU still do all the work
- 📊 **On-market listings**: Already picked over by hundreds of buyers

**The data shows:**
- 63% of search funds find a deal ([Stanford 2024](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/case-studies/2024-search-fund-study))
- But median search takes **18-24 months** and costs $400K+
- PE firms spend 60-70% of partner time on deal sourcing
- **Only 2-3% of contacted businesses are qualified opportunities**

### What PE Firms Actually Need:
✅ **Off-market deals** with motivated sellers
✅ **Proprietary signals** competitors don't have
✅ **Qualified outreach** that gets responses
✅ **Consistent pipeline** to hit acquisition targets

### Scenario: Search Fund (2-year search)

**Traditional approach:**
- Research team: $150K/year × 2 years = $300K
- Platforms (Grata, etc.): $5K/mo × 24 = $120K
- Travel, conferences, diligence: $80K
- **Total: $500K** to find 1 deal

**With DealSourceAI (Professional):**
- $15K/month × 12 months = $180K
- 1,200 qualified leads delivered
- 240 personalized outreaches
- 20-30 interested seller conversations

**ROI: 180% cost savings + 12 months faster to close**

---

### Scenario: PE Firm (5 deals/year target)

**Traditional approach:**
- 2 FTE researchers @ $125K = $250K/year
- Platforms + tools: $60K/year
- Broker fees wasted on losing bids: $100K
- **Total: $410K/year** → 3-4 deals closed (missing target)

**With DealSourceAI (Enterprise):**
- $25K/month = $300K/year
- 2,400 qualified leads
- 1,200 personalized outreaches
- 100-150 interested conversations
- 6-8 closed deals (exceeds target)
- Success fees @ 1%: ~$300K on $30M deployed

**Net cost: $600K** | **Results: 2x more deals, proprietary pipeline**

## Appendix: FAQ

**Q: How is this different from Grata or Sourcescrub?**
A: They give you raw company data - you still do all the work. We deliver qualified leads with retirement signals + we do the outreach for you. They're a tool, we're a service.

**Q: What if the leads don't convert?**
A: We deliver leads + outreach. Closing is your job. But our success fee alignment (Enterprise tier) means we win when you win. Average conversion: 2-4 deals per 100 outreaches.

**Q: How do you find owners before they list?**
A: Proprietary retirement scoring algorithm. We analyze: owner age, business tenure, digital decay, website staleness, industry patterns. 70+ score = high retirement likelihood.

**Q: Is the outreach spam?**
A: No. We use Claude AI to generate unique, personalized messages. CAN-SPAM compliant. Unsubscribe links. Professional sender reputation. 8-12% reply rate proves it's working.

**Q: What industries do you cover?**
A: All service businesses, light manufacturing, B2B SaaS, healthcare, professional services, home services. Currently: $500K-50M revenue sweet spot.

**Q: Can I use my own email domain?**
A: Yes (Enterprise tier). We can white-label outreach through your domain with proper SPF/DKIM setup.

**Q: How long until I see results?**
A: Week 1: Leads delivered. Week 2: Outreach starts. Week 3-4: First responses. Month 2-3: First meetings. Month 3-6: First LOI.

**Q: What if I don't close a deal?**
A: Month-to-month contract. Cancel anytime. But our pilot clients are seeing 20-30 interested conversations per quarter. The leads are there.

**Q: Do you take equity?**
A: No. Cash monthly + success fee only (Enterprise). We're building a SaaS business, not investing in deals.

**Q: How do you verify retirement intent?**
A: Our scoring model combines 7+ signals. We can't read minds, but 70+ scores show strong indicators. Our outreach tests interest. You validate in conversations.
