## Client Testimonials

> "I spent 6 months manually sourcing. Got maybe 3 decent conversations. First month with DealSourceAI, I had 7 calls with interested sellers. Two are now in LOI stage. This is a game-changer."
>
> **— Search fund searcher, HBS '23**

> "The retirement scoring is legit. Every lead I called was at least open to a conversation. Compare that to cold LinkedIn outreach where 95% ignore you. Worth every penny."
>
> **— Independent sponsor, former PE associate**

> "We were spending $150K/year on two researchers. Now we spend $300K on DealSourceAI and get 3x the qualified pipeline. Plus our researchers can focus on deeper diligence instead of lead generation."

## Appendix: Methodology

### How We Score Retirement Likelihood (0-100)

**Owner Demographics (35 points max)**
- Age 65+: 20 points
- Age 60-64: 15 points
- Age 55-59: 10 points
- Tenure 20+ years: +15 points
- Tenure 15-19 years: +10 points

**Digital Signals (30 points max)**
- Website not updated 3+ years: 15 points
- No social media 2+ years: 15 points
- Outdated technology stack: 10 points
- Declining online presence: 5 points

**Business Indicators (20 points max)**
- No new hires 2+ years: 10 points
- No equipment purchases 3+ years: 10 points
- Declining trade show presence: 5 points
- No new certifications/training: 5 points

**Industry Context (15 points max)**
- High-retirement industry (>35%): 15 points
- Medium retirement (25-35%): 10 points
- Age wave timing: 5 points

**Total: 100 points possible**

**Scoring Tiers:**
- 90-100: Extremely high likelihood (probably actively thinking about exit)
- 80-89: Very high likelihood (open to conversation)
- 70-79: High likelihood (will respond to right approach)
- 60-69: Moderate likelihood (worth nurturing)
- <60: Lower priority

### Why This Works Better Than Traditional Research

**Traditional approach looks at:**
- Company financials (if available)
- Industry trends
- Geographic factors

**They MISS the human element:** Owner readiness

**Our approach focuses on:**
- Owner age + tenure (psychological readiness)
- Digital decay (mental checkout signals)
- Behavioral indicators (declining investment in business)

**Result:** We identify sellers 12-24 months BEFORE they list with brokers. That's your competitive advantage.
