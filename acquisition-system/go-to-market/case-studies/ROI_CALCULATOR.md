## Objection Handling with ROI

### Objection: "This is too expensive"

**Response:**
"I hear you. $15K/month feels like a lot.

But let's do the math:
- You're spending [X] hours/week on sourcing right now
- Your time is worth $[Y]/hour (conservatively)
- That's $[Z]/month in opportunity cost JUST from your time

DealSourceAI costs $15K but saves you [X] hours/week. That's worth $[Z].

Plus, we deliver 100 qualified leads. If you tried to build that list yourself:
- 100 companies × 15 min research each = 25 hours
- Email enrichment: $0.50-1 per lead = $50-100
- Outreach personalization: 20 × 30 min = 10 hours

We're doing 35+ hours of work per month, PLUS using $5K/month AI tools, for $15K.

The question isn't 'is this expensive?' - it's 'what's the cost of NOT doing this?'"

---

### Objection: "I can do this myself"

**Response:**
"You absolutely can. And maybe you should try it first to appreciate what we're doing.

Here's what you'll need:
- Scraping infrastructure: 40-60 hours to build
- Data enrichment: $500-1000/month for tools
- AI for personalization: $300-500/month (Claude API)
- Time to run it: 10-15 hours/week

Total: ~100 hours upfront + 10-15 hours/week ongoing.

Quick math:
- 100 hours × $300/hr = $30K upfront cost
- 10 hours/week × $300 = $3K/week = $12K/month opportunity cost
- Tools: $800-1500/month

**DIY Cost: $30K setup + $13.5K/month**

**DealSourceAI: $0 setup + $15K/month**

We save you 100 hours upfront and 10 hours/week ongoing.

Still want to build it yourself? I respect that. Call me in 3 months when you realize how hard this is."

---

### Objection: "What if the leads don't convert?"

**Response:**
"Great question. Let's be realistic about conversion rates:

**Traditional cold outreach:**
- 1,000 companies researched
- 200 have contact info (20% hit rate)
- 200 emails sent
- 6-10 responses (3-5% reply rate)
- 2-3 turn into calls
- 1 becomes a deal (0.1% conversion)

**DealSourceAI:**
- 1,000 companies scored
- 800 have contact info (80% hit rate from waterfall)
- 100 outreach sent (we pre-qualify with retirement scores)
- 8-12 responses (8-12% reply rate from personalization)
- 4-6 turn into calls
- 1-2 become deals (0.1-0.2% conversion)

So yes, most leads won't convert. That's normal.

But we're giving you 2-5x MORE qualified conversations per month.

And remember: You only need to find ONE deal. Even if our conversion is the same as traditional (it's not, it's better), you'll find it faster because we're feeding you way more qualified opportunities.

One searcher told me: 'I don't care if 90 out of 100 leads go nowhere. The 10 conversations I had were worth the price.'"
