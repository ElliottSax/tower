4. **Technology ready:** 95% complete platform, just need customers
5. **Fast execution:** Move quickly, lock in first 10 clients before competition

### What Could Go Wrong:
1. **Product doesn't deliver:** Mitigate by over-delivering in pilots
2. **Can't get first clients:** Mitigate with 400+ prospects, strong pitch
