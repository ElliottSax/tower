## 🎯 The Evidence (Why This Works)

### From Strategic Portfolio Director
> "BookCLI should be 5% of resources, not 80%. Discovery has $2.88M ARR ceiling vs BookCLI $200K ceiling. Deploy, don't build - 65,000 LOC already shipped."

### From Catalog Audit Agent
> "39 books ready NOW with $30K-41K/month potential. Existing 19 books average 94.4/100 quality using premium LLMs."

### From Perpetual Pipeline Test
> "91.7% chapter failure rate with free-tier LLMs. Fatal bug in quality scorer prevents 95% of output."

### From Market Intelligence Director
> "Options analytics: $2M-10M TAM, proven demand. Congressional trading: $1M-5M TAM. KDP publishing: HIGH RISK due to Amazon AI crackdown."
