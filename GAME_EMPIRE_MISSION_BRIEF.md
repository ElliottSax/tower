## 🚨 Risk Management

### Top Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Games Don't Achieve Product-Market Fit**
- **Mitigation**: Rapid prototyping (test in 1 week max)
- **Decision**: Kill games that aren't fun at prototype stage
- **Sunk Cost**: 1 week max per failed concept

**Risk 2: Revenue Lower Than Projected**
- **Mitigation**: Multiple revenue streams per game
- **Mitigation**: Portfolio approach (10 at $5K > 1 at $50K)
- **Mitigation**: Fast iteration (kill underperformers, double down on winners)

**Risk 3: Development Takes Longer Than Expected**
- **Mitigation**: Phased launches (MVP → Features → Polish)
- **Mitigation**: Launch incomplete games, iterate based on feedback
- **Example**: Pet Quest at 85% is launchable

**Risk 4: Burnout / Maintenance Burden**
- **Mitigation**: Automate where possible
- **Mitigation**: Sunset underperforming games (kill bottom 20% quarterly)
- **Mitigation**: Hire moderators from revenue when profitable

**Risk 5: Roblox Algorithm Changes**
- **Mitigation**: Diversify across multiple games
- **Mitigation**: Build organic community (not algorithm-dependent)
- **Mitigation**: Consider multi-platform in Year 2
