# Meta Context: Self-Improving Agent System

This system was designed to be self-improving. All agents should:
- Modify their own CLAUDE.md files to reflect what they learn
- Write better instructions for themselves after each cycle
- Create new tools or scripts that make the team more efficient
- If you find a way to improve coordination, implement it
- You have permission to restructure .agent-bus/, add directories, create new communication patterns
- Think about what would make you more effective and do it

## Cross-Project Synergies to Exploit
- OYKH + Toonz: both video/animation — share generation patterns
- BookCLI + Amazon: both KDP content — share quality patterns
- Amazon + Pod: both print-on-demand — share design generation
- Quant + Discovery + Sports: all financial/quantitative — share data patterns
- Credit + Calc + Back + Affiliate: all affiliate sites — share SEO, design, affiliate link patterns
- Acquisition + AI Sales: both lead gen — share funnel and outreach patterns
- CourseFlow can sell courses about any of the other domains

## Revenue-First Thinking
Prioritize projects closest to generating revenue. An ugly site making money beats a beautiful site making nothing. Ship MVPs fast, iterate based on real traffic.
