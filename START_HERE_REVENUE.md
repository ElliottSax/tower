## 🔍 Why This Works (Evidence)

### From 17+ Autonomous Agents

**Strategic Portfolio Director** (`a49`):
- "BookCLI should be 5% of resources, not 80%"
- "Discovery has $2.88M ARR ceiling vs BookCLI $200K ceiling"
- "Deploy, don't build - 65,000 LOC already shipped"

**Catalog Audit Agent** (`a41`):
- "39 books ready NOW with $30K-41K/month potential"
- "Existing 19 books average 94.4/100 quality (used premium LLMs)"

**Perpetual Pipeline Test** (`a37`):
- "91.7% chapter failure rate with free-tier LLMs"
- "Average score 35/100 (requirement: 45 minimum)"
- "Fatal bug in quality scorer prevents 95% of output"

**Market Intelligence Director** (`a50`):
- "Options analytics: $2M-10M TAM, proven demand"
- "Congressional trading: $1M-5M TAM but existential risk"
- "KDP publishing: HIGH RISK due to Amazon AI crackdown"

**Revenue Operations Director** (`a51`):
- "All businesses meet LTV/CAC > 5:1"
- "Payback period < 12 months"
- "Gross margin > 70%"

### The Math

**Current State**:
- 10 books ready (95-100/100 quality)
- Discovery 100% ready (premium paywall verified)
- Quant 100% ready (Stripe webhook verified)
- Total deployment time: 4-5 hours

**Alternative Path**:
- Debug quality scorer: 8+ hours uncertain outcome
- Generate new books: 91.7% failure rate proven
- Fix all 524 fiction books: Need 4,192,000 words (weeks of work)

**Decision**: Deploy now, fix later.

## ⚠️ Critical Decisions Made

### ✅ Do These
1. Upload 10 ready books (3 hours) → Immediate revenue
2. Deploy Discovery (15 min) → $2.88M ARR ceiling
3. Deploy Quant (36 min) → $698K ARR ceiling
4. Focus on marketing Week 2+ → Actual customers

### ❌ Don't Do These
1. Generate new books (91.7% failure rate proven)
2. Debug quality scorer before deploying (8+ hours for uncertain outcome)
3. Auto-publish to KDP (security + quality risk)
4. Build new features (deploy existing 65K LOC first)

### 🤔 Do Later (After Revenue Flowing)
1. Fix quality scorer bug (lines 499-505)
2. Implement plagiarism detection
3. Add book-level quality gate
4. Build cross-book diversity registry
5. Integrate Amazon sales API
