## 💰 PART 2: PAID MARKETING (Budget: $100-$500/month)

### **When to Start Paid Ads**

**DON'T Start If:**
- Game isn't fun yet (fix retention first)
- Critical bugs present
- ARPDAU < $0.30 (you'll lose money)
- D1 retention < 25%

**DO Start When:**
- D1 retention > 35%
- ARPDAU > $0.50
- LTV > CPI (profitable!)
- Stable build (no crashes)

### **Google Universal App Campaigns (UAC)**

**Why UAC:**
- Automatic optimization
- Shows across Google network
- Good for app installs
- Easy to set up

**Campaign Setup:**
1. Google Ads → New Campaign
2. Goal: App promotion
3. App: Treasure Chase
4. Budget: $10/day (start small!)
5. Target: Worldwide (or specific countries)
6. Bid strategy: Target CPI ($0.50-$2.00)

**Ad Assets:**
- 4 text headlines (30 chars each)
- 5 description lines (90 chars each)
- 4 images (1200x628)
- 1 video (landscape, 30s)

**Example Headlines:**
```
"Run Through Endless Worlds!"
"Dodge, Jump, Collect Treasures"
"#1 Endless Runner of 2026"
"Download Free - Play Offline!"
```

**Optimization:**
- Let run for 7 days before judging
- Monitor CPI (target <$2.00)
- Check retention (should match organic)
- Scale up if profitable
