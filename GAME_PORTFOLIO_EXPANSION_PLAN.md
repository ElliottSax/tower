---

## ⚠️ Risk Management

### Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Game Doesn't Achieve Product-Market Fit**
- **Mitigation**: Rapid prototyping (test core loop in 1 week)
- **Decision Point**: If not fun at prototype stage, abandon
- **Sunk Cost**: 1 week max per failed concept

**Risk 2: Roblox Algorithm Changes**
- **Mitigation**: Diversify across multiple games
- **Mitigation**: Build organic community (not algorithm-dependent)
- **Mitigation**: Consider multi-platform (Unity mobile)

**Risk 3: Development Takes Longer Than Expected**
- **Mitigation**: Phased launches (MVP → Features → Polish)
- **Mitigation**: Launch incomplete games, iterate based on feedback
- **Example**: Pet Quest at 85% is launchable

**Risk 4: Revenue Lower Than Projected**
- **Mitigation**: Multiple revenue streams per game
- **Mitigation**: Portfolio approach (10 games at $5K > 1 game at $50K)
- **Mitigation**: Fast iteration (kill underperformers, double down on winners)

**Risk 5: Burnout / Maintenance Burden**
- **Mitigation**: Automate where possible (scripts, monitoring)
- **Mitigation**: Community moderation (hire moderators from revenue)
- **Mitigation**: Sunset underperforming games (kill bottom 20% quarterly)

## 💡 Key Insights

### What Works
1. **Proven Genres**: Pet collection, idle, obby all have massive markets
2. **Roblox Platform**: Zero server costs, built-in distribution, huge audience
3. **Phased Launches**: Launch MVP, fund later development from revenue
4. **Multiple Revenue Streams**: Reduces dependence on any single monetization method
5. **AI-Assisted Development**: Claude Code enables solo developer to build AAA games

### What to Avoid
1. **Unproven Genres**: Don't invent new genres, iterate on proven ones
2. **Perfectionism**: Launch at 80% complete, iterate based on feedback
3. **Single Game Dependence**: Portfolio approach reduces risk
4. **Pay-to-Win**: Ethical monetization has better long-term retention
5. **Mobile Security Issues**: If doing Unity mobile, use MobileGameCore SDK

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Retention**: Games must be fun enough to bring players back daily
2. **Monetization Balance**: Revenue without hurting gameplay experience
3. **Community**: Active players create viral growth and feedback loops
4. **Speed**: Launch fast, iterate faster, kill slow performers
5. **Portfolio Thinking**: 10 games at $5K > 1 game at $50K (risk management)
